Today we reviewed out written test and was surprised to do slightly better than I thought. 

Lecture covered the basics of Java in the morning and we proceeded to create a simpe payroll calculator.
After lunch and additional lecture on conditionals, we were tasked to expand out pay calculators.

We also were tasked with creating an adventure story using the conditionals.  This forced us to continue learning deeper into Java and how to creat various things.
