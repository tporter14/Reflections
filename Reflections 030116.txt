Today we began with our first scrum meeting to discuss what we learned the previous day.  We proceeded to learn about Command Line and Batch files. I felt pretty good when I was able to successfully run the files as I was trying to.

In the afternoon, we began HTML and CSS lectures followed by applying what we learned.  I made numerous changes to the basic website we started to build.  I will still need more work to feel comfortable at making the changes I want.
